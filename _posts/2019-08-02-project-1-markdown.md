Overwatch is a very popular FPS video game that was released in May 2016.  This project explores a dataset that was scraped on April 22, 2019.  I will explore the data on win rates of the heroes in the game.

## Heroes vs Win Rate
### Which heroes has the best win rates. You will be surprised according to this graph.

Oddly enough this data shows that Symmetra, Brigitte, and Torbjorn are on top 3 of the list. The is somewhat unexpected because it is pretty well known that at least Torbjorn and Symmetra are not the strongest heores in the game.

#### This graph shows the win rates of the heroes on different gaming platforms.

Interestingly, despite the fact that PC plays a lot different than Playstation and Xbox due to using mouse and keybard vs. controllers, the data shows that all platforms show similar win rate among all the heroes. You would think there would be some differences between PC and consoles but it doesnt.

### Here is thought, would the heroes with a higher "on fire" rate during the game have a higher win rates ?

Surprisingly, according to this data, heroes with a higher "on fire" rate doe not translate into correlating win rate
