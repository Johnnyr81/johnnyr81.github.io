Overwatch is a very popular FPS video game that was released in May 2016.  This project explores a dataset that was scraped on April 22, 2019.  I will explore the data on win rates of the heroes in the game.

## Heroes vs Win Rate
### Which heroes had the best win rates on April 22, 2019. You will be surprised according to this graph.

Oddly enough this data shows that Symmetra, Brigitte, and Torbjorn are on top 3 of the list. The is somewhat unexpected because it is pretty well known that at least Torbjorn and Symmetra are not the strongest heores in the game. Popular damage heroes Genji, Tracer, McCree are actually at the bottom of the list. This might be due to the fact that this dataset included the win rates from all game modes such as quick play and no limits where gamers play the game more casually. Another interesting thing is that the win rate does not vary too much between the heroes and only span from about 46% to 57.5%, showing you that no matter which hero you pick, the win rate will always hover around the middle.

#### Will playing on different gaming platforms show different win rates ?.

Interestingly, despite the fact that PC plays a lot different than Playstation and Xbox due to using mouse and keyboard vs. controllers, the data shows that all platforms show similar win rates among all the heroes. You would think there would be some differences between PC and consoles but it doesnt.

### Here is thought, would the heroes with a higher "on fire" rate during the game have a higher win rates ?

Surprisingly, according to this data, heroes with a higher "on fire" rate doe not translate into win rates. This might be due to the fact that this game requires more teamwork among player to win rather than individual player's perfromance.
