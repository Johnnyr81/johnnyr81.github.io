title: Data Science Unit 1 Project 1
Win rate analysis in Overwatch on April 22 2019
---

Overwatch is a very popular FPS video game that was released in May 2016.  This project explores data that was scraped on April 22, 2019.  I will explore the data on win rate of the heroes in the game.

## Heroes vs Winrate
Which chracter has the best win rate. You will be surprised according to this rate.

Oddly enough this data shows Symmetra, Brigitte, and Torbjorn on top of the list. The data is very odd because it is very well known that Torbjorn and Symmetra are not the strogest heores to play in the game.

Interestingly, the data for all the platforms is very similar, despite the fact that PC plays a lot different than the consoles, Playstation and Xbox due to using mouse and keybard vs. controllers. You would think there would be some differences between PC and consoles but it doesnt.

Surprisingly heroes with higher on fire rate doe not translate into win rate
